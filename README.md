### Libraries Used, if so why did you choose them
- React
- React Bootstrap for CSS
- Axios for making http request to server


### What you would do if you had more time

- Stylize the App better.
- Troubleshoot CORS error and handle it when queried for some users.
- Implement Filter based on different parameters like company, number of followers, location, etc.
